## Welcome to OpenSIST ðŸ‘‹

Launched by the class of 2024 undergraduate students at ShanghaiTech University, OpenSIST is an open-source overseas graduate application reference platform for SISTors. Faced with the lack of previous overseas application information, this platform provides comprehensive information for SISTors, including brief introductions to graduate school programs, admissions datapoints of previous SISTors, etc.

We hope this platform can help you as much as possible when you're applying to grad schools outside Mainland China, and wish you good luck with your applications!
